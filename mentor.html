    <h1>Meet Linus Torvalds</h1>

        <p> Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux Operating System, was born December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. His
            grandfather had a Commodore VIC-20 that he had the opportunity to work with; by age ten he was already
            dabbling in programming. He enrolled at the University of Helsinki in 1989, and in 1990 he took his first C
            programming class.
        </p>

            In 1991, Torvalds decided that his new MS-DOS-driven PC needed an alternative operating system. He had
            enough programming know-how under his belt to assume that he could achieve this himself. His goal was to
            create a UNIX-like operating system he could use at home. Using the Marice J. Bach book “Design of the Unix
            Operating System” as a guide, he set out to create the system, working long, hard hours until, at age 22, he
            completed a rough version. He called his system “Linux,” a combination of UNIX and his name, and posted the
            source code free on the Internet.
